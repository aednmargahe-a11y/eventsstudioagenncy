<!-- 1. Add this audio element (usually in the <body> section, right after <body> tag) -->
<audio id="bgMusic" loop preload="auto">
    <source src="Song-bg.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="assets/Song-bg.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<!-- 2. Add this script (usually before closing </body> tag) -->
<script src="js/background-music.js"></script>

<!-- 
IMPORTANT: 
- Make sure the file "js/background-music.js" exists in your website
